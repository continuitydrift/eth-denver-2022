# Chapter Nine

Sunitha was getting used to virtual reality, but she still hated it. The future, she'd said over and over, is **augmented** reality. Cyborgs not robots. That was the dialectic of musical history, and probably history in general: blind trust in human instinct, followed by a blind trust in human reason. Both extremes causing disasters. Folksy tambourine-slapping swerving into the regimented nightmare of drum-machines, followed, hopefully, by a synthesis into the type of electronic music that tried to make machines sound human, and not the other way around.

Nico, on the other hand, loved it. It let him interface with people more on the level of their pure intellectuality, not the hugely rooted tree of genetic phylogeny that he had to think about when developing the game. He was getting used to working on the game, but he still hated it. Damien and Marcus, and Sunitha (already) assumed by his background, literally and figuratively, that he was wealthy. He had been, earlier in life, but all that had really gotten him was the capacity to be more impressively in debt. Part of it was nobility on his part, not in the genetic sense (he was Romanian *Roma*), but in the sense of wanting to preserve an actual castle from demolition and development. Literal or figurative. There was a joke, after all, about the king of the gypsies.

"Do you mind if I just watch this on my phone?" she asked.

Nico sighed, in reality but not virtually. "No, my dear. How can I begrudge you reality? When I was your age, I would much rather be looking into a mirror than trapped in some scanner darkly helmet. It is pretty impressive, though, I mean for VR?"

"I hate the term VR," Sunitha said. "All acronyms actually. See, this is why you shouldn't have given me all of the money up front. There's no incentive for me not to insult things you're probably invested in."

"Literally and figuratively," Nico said, typing in the unicode for the appropriate emoji, which appeared floating above his avatar, which was a bright pink flamingo wearing a superflous plastic, high-definition floater in garish neons. It was a classic case of deflection, drawing attention to the part of his body (his growing midsection, which he was self-conscious about to the point of distraction) in order to draw attention, instead, to the floaty-holographic interface orbiting his mid-riff. "What would you have done, instead?"

"What?" Sunitha answered. She was equally shocked and amused by the old man's bluntness. "What time is it there, by the way?"

"Three in the morning. Who cares? I'm curious, what would you have done?"

"It all depends," she said carefully. "How many other people have you given this amount to? What precedent would I have set before I even got to this hypothetical point where I can decide how much and when I would have paid myself?"

"Forget about yourself," Nico said, puppeting the flamigo head like a *bunraku* puppet with his *wasd* macros. "Let's try to think of things in the abstract. You aren't yourself. You are some procedurally generated incarnation of a timeless avatar of logic."

"Are you drunk?" Sunitha asked.

"No, not tonight. You aren't drinking, so it would be impolite."

"Then why are you talking like that?"

Nico sighed again, figuratively and literally. "Forgive me. Consider it a...what do you call it? A 'Live Action Role Play?'"

"You're A LARPER?!" Sunitha shouted, loud enough at the end that she had to glance habitually around to see who was listening. Sunil was, based only the sounds of some indo-european language coming from the other side of he room, in his own conversation, but probably subconsciously matching demands for auditory space. Literally and figuratively.

"I'm a thespian," Nico said with dignity, fluffing his feathers. "One adapts. So as to not become irrelevant."

"Okay," Sunitha said, laughing. "It trust you. I mean, the cello sounds awesome."

When Nico had done his characteristic, "I will give you ten thousand dollars in the crypto currency of your choice," Sunitha had responded, without missing a beat, "I need someone to look at my instruments. It's cold here, and some of the wood panels in the body have come unglued."

"Okay, Nico had said. "Find out if he takes CashSend. Or however you want it."

Sunitha had nodded. This had been a normal Boom call, or whatever open source equivalent that Nico was trying to foist on her. She'd taken a habit to reading the terms of agreement for suspicious-looking software, and the click-throughs for this video call had been a master-class in absurdist, self-referential legal comedy. There was, however, a disturbing filter, that seemed suspiciously like those she'd read about sometimes got assigned as malware by anonymous hackers to warn potential collaborators from having to do with back actors with a history of malfeasance.

"I want it given to the local luthier here in Denver. Here's his card and Flitter profile. Tell him it's store credit for work on my instruments. I'll be in the shop on Saturday."

She'd gone into the shop, and the owner had showed her a variety of new instruments, counseling her with a countenance as serious as if some Sutra depended on it, that she should buy new, rare or hand-made pieces rather than throwing her money away on a sitar with a broken spine.

"No," she had told the luthier. "This is my grandfather. Make him whole."

The sitar, and the cello, sounded better than they had in years.

"Thank you," Nico said. "For trusting me. And I trust you, as well. If you like, I can dispense with this whimsical interface."

"No," Sunitha said, smiling. He reminded her of her uncle. "It's how much you like it. It's like watching my little cousins listen to hip-hop for the first time."

"So, what would you have done, instead?"

"Give me half of what you gave me, and the right to delegate the other half to people who might collaborate with me. That's the model we came up with for the Glider Guns."

"Okay," Nico said, sunglasses appearing in front of his flamingo eyes, making his expression inscrutable, "you have the right to delegate the half of what I gave you, that you didn't spend on fixing a sitar and guitar, to whomever you chose."

It didn't work that way, Sunitha thought. Who knew where this strange guy's funding was coming from? Was it the same as what she, and her tight-knit group of friends had agreed upon?

"Sunil can make anyone sound good," she said. "These instruments...Look, if you are reasonably competent as a musician, you can use money as an instrument. Especially if you can recognize the physical ability of the people involved in the craft of making them."

"Look, someone's here. I'll call you back."

"Okay," Nico said, leaving the helmet on. He'd wanted to ask her about Chase. He sent her an email.

> When you get a chance, tell me what you think of Chase. Everyone else we on-board gets the same deal as what I described. Half up front, then you have to use the other half to pay people other than yourself. The delegatory division of the para-gaming org funding the project supposedly game theoried everything out to maximize co-operation and reliable results, but that only works if everyone gets along well enough to communicate. Any residual or derivative contracts based on the initial assets is up to you.

Nico did the rounds of his virtual castle. The tapestries on the walls showed a rotating collection curated by the bio-feedback of ten thousand or so users of the software some of the Daemon Dao founders had released. The entire game was open source, but Nico did tend to accumulate a lot of access privileges and beta whitelisting from grateful guild-members he had sponsored. He had to admit, there was something sinister about his choices in virtual d√©cor. Partly leaning into the daemon thing, partly exorcising the religious memes planted by an orthodox education, re-emerging unwelcome after a life-long relationship with atheism.

Sunitha called him, using proprietary conferencing software, so by the time he'd made sure that his VPN was active he was afraid she would hang up. "Hello? Sunitha?"

"Hey! So, Chase and Babacar are actually here, playing some kind of board game. You could talk to them if you want."

The flamingo flapped its wings, and stood on one foot. "Of course, let me just grab some coffee. B-r-b."
