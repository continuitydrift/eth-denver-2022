Chapter 7

"Say you have two six-sided dice," the young man was saying to her, politely, with the energy probably residual from pitching the same idea to dozens of people already today. By now, he could recite the bullet points as promptly as if he were reciting them from a teleprompter. "The most likely outcomes from a single roll will be a six, or a seven."

"Why?" Matty asked, also watching the rest of the hotel room from the corners of her eyes. She'd been coming back from a couple of drinks with some friends who were in town, unrelated to the conference, figuring that she might as well take inspiration from the younger generation and spend one night out late. As she'd been struggling to unlock the door with her phone, the young girl (young to her) in the room next to her showed up, whispering with her group of friends, but a stage whisper that wasn't really fooling anyone. No one would complain.

They'd struck up a polite conversation, Matty complimenting her on her music, telling her she owned one of the NFTs, and had listened to it several times. They invited her in. She'd declined automatically, but when they offered a second time she had shrugged, and said, "just for a minute."

There were seven people in the hotel room, about half of them wearing masks, taking them down to sip tea or beer. When she had accepted the tea rather than beer, saying she'd had too many already, they nodded, knowingly. "Us, too. Here, this will help." The chai was delicious, with cardamom and cloves, gingery sweet.

"The number of combinations where it is possible to roll those numbers is different," Babacar was saying, He seemed more of an outsider in this group. Not that the others were unfriendly to him, just that they didn't know him as well as they knew each other. Which explained, perhaps why he'd self-elected to carry on a conversation with her.

"Take a six. Three and three, A two and a four, and a one and a five. Same with a seven. Three different possible combinations. With an eight, nine, four, and five, there are only two."

Matty didn't make the effort to follow the calculations in her head, but she got what he was saying. "And some, I'm guessing, only have one."

"Right! And rolling a one with two six-sided dice is impossible. So basically, you have these hexagonal flowers, and you can make a table for determining outcomes. We turned the possible endings of the graphic novel into NFTs, and numbers they represent on the table, meaning the likelihood of their being chosen, is fixed, via smart contract, to the price."

"I don't understand all of that, but it sounds like a great idea."

"One last, thing, though: we wanted the gamification element to be decoupled from the price of the NFTs, so we're not just reproducing oligarchic concentrations of power. So the number of times it was traded, even if they were wash trades at the same price, works as a magnifier. Of course a given pair of addresses are only allowed to buy and sell once between them. So we reward having a large group of friends that you can trust, even poor ones."

Matty thought she heard a note of frustration in his voice, maybe even bitterness. Yes, she thought, even the poor ones.

"What about you?" Babacar asked her. She wondered if he was Muslim, and if some of the others had made tea so he wouldn't feel uncomfortable for being the only one not drinking. Maybe that was cynical of her.

"The organization I work for funds different types of conservation and climate projects. I'm not involved in any one of them, in particular, but I'm here to snoop around and see if there's anything interesting that could use some angel investment, that might pay off later on, or qualify for grants they don't know they might qualify for."

"Did you find anything?" he asked, his eyes focused with alert interest.

She laughed, slightly uncomfortable. "Yes, of course. There's one project that's trying to incentivize saving species from extinction. It sounds horrible, but there are parallels with the kind of game theory you were describing. They're thinking about how to gamify NFTs for these dying animals, but in such a way that produces actual conservation outcomes, not speculative gains by people who have too much money anyway, and no real stake in the environment."

"How were they trying to do that?"

She frowned, concentrating, slightly annoyed that her powers of recall and rhetoric were being tested this late at night, when her brain was used to unwinding into sleep. He seemed curious, though, and she didn't want to be rude.

"Fixing the price of a given species, or the token for it, at current population levels. If the population drops to zero, the tokens for anyone holding them become worthless. Conversely, if they manage on saving the habitat necessary, or passing legislation, or whatever the defacto DAO decides to do, they could end up making money. The price isn't due to a fixed supply, but to rewards promised in the programmable contracts, backed up by the treasury of the foundation."

Babacar nodded, solemnly. "I don't know too many investors that would make that bet."

Matty sighed. "No," she said, "me either."
