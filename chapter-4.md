# Chapter 4

"Hello, My name is Sunitha. I'm one of the Glider Guns." There were a few cheers from the back of the room. "I'm also working on a Master's in Comp Sci at MIT, here with a classmate, but we're actually not competing in the Hackathon. For one thing, our project is both virtual and in person, so we wouldn't qualify for the bounties. The rules are too restrictive for us. There's no way we could pick just four people, or finish by the time the hackathon is over. We extend too far, in time and space. For another thing, we don't believe in competition." A different part of the small auditorium burst into brief, spontaneous applause. She smiled at them. "I mean, artificial scarcity is the problem, right? Why become dependent on hand-outs, when we can use this conference instead as a launchpad for exogenous, decentralized funding. I mean, isn't that what blockchains are all about?" This time there was no applause, and she guessed she might have gone too far.

"Anyway, we don't like rules, accept the ones we agree to, and I did agree to the six minute limit, so I'll try to be short. I don't plan on leaving any time for questions, though, so please find me afterwards if you want to connect, or go to longgliders.io, download the app, or join or Accord channel. We'll be playing at the Temple Friday night, so you can also find us at the afterparty." It seemed like she won them back, and she let a murmur work its way around the back rows before she started again.

Neither the small audience in the dozens or so rows in front of her, nor the camera that was broadcasting the presentations on Witch bothered her in the slightest. Music performances had accustomed her to both milieus, but it was more than that. Public speaking or live streaming had never bothered her. It seemed normal to her, and the symptoms of stage fright other people described never made any sense, like people describing some kind of phobia or mental disorder. Conversation in small groups, however, or one-on-one, almost always gave her sweaty palms. In front of a crowd, you were *safe*. There was a performance, a set list, a script, and everyone knew to play alone. It was when you were alone with other people that things got dangerous.

"The name of our band comes from a cellular automaton in the mathematical game Life, that was invented in the seventies. You know, the grid of cells that are turned on or off based on how many neighbors they have? The name of the project, Garden State, which will also be our second album, refers to the initial configuration of squares that people in the game try to figure out, in order to produce elegant or perpetual results down the line. Come to the show, and you'll see some examples projected onto the stage, thanks to Benton, our videographer, lighting, and graphic designer. He couldn't make it. Neither could our bassist or vocalist, sadly."

"We do algorithmic, generative music, combined with live looping and human learning. We say human learning rather than machine learning because human audiences are the environment in which our little musical organism, or memes, survive and replicate. Anyone who visits the website can download an NFT that will be a melodic or rhythmic fragment. Please, though, don't do it now." There was laughter, again, half the people in the crowd having reflexively pulled out their phones. "I think there's still time, so let me invite Sunil on stage for a quick demonstration."

Unlike her, Sunil hated speaking in front of people, especially without his sound board to hide behind. He joined her awkwardly. She took out her phone, and mentally crossing her fingers, unlocked it and opened the app, bringing up one of the original NFTs. The sound of her playing violin went from the phone into the microphone, filling the room. It was a phrase two measures long (they had considered only one measure as the initial configuration, but ended up deciding it wasn't a large enough fragment), repeating more or less seamlessly. Sunitha walked away from the podium, to the far side of the stage, and Sunil took her place, holding the base of his phone up to the microphone, his mouth twitching with nervousness as the beat, a cross between lo-fi and future garage, rendered with Manish's percussive bass.

Sunitha walked towards him, the sound of the violin melody coming not from her phone, but through his. Things went a little staticky, glitchy, the bass extending like it was passing through a hard filter, or the app was buffering, and then the violin part sped up, shifting up a few notes, while the bass line flopped into synch, morphing in pitch and tempo.

"And there you have it!" Sunitha said, flashing her smile again. "We just minted a new NFT, combining the properties of both musical fragments. It's similar to the familiar concept of *breeding* monsters in combat games, but here we're *jamming* instead, right? Collaboration over competition. Abundance over scarcity.

She wasn't sure about this next part, if it would make sense to anyone or help her case, but she couldn't resist. "The interesting thing is that the notes, like the rhythm, are finding a median between themselves, which doesn't always lead to expected results. If you have something in the key of A, for example, and the key of C, the algorithm will adjust the base note to the exact middle, which would be...B sharp, or C flat, which musicians will recognize doesn't actually exist. It's a made up note. So we're not just evolving new *notes*, we're evolving new *keys*. After all, there's nothing in musical theory that says 440 Hz has to equal a middle A, right?

"Okay, okay, that's a little technical, but if two of you, people in the audience, claim your air drop NFTs from Garden State, and you connect with each other via the app, like we just did, but then take the resulting NFT and combine it with the mash-up NFT that *we* just created, what will happen?

"Well, if the NFTs are tagged differently, like 'bass line,' 'synths', 'percussion', and 'melody', then they will combine into a four-track fragment. If they have the same tags, then they might combine into four different *measures*, right, which may or may not fit together. Here is where things get interesting." She nodded to Sunil, who was making his way back to his seat. A lot of what she was about to describe hadn't actually been coded yet. For years, this had been their *modus operandi*: she came up with ideas on the spot, and later, staring at his computer screen, Sunil had made them happen. It was their dance, their way of pushing each other beyond where they would otherwise go.

"Once you start with this higher-level breeding," she said, "multiple variants are created, different NFTs keyed to the musical memo-type, or mnemo-type. The variants are assigned an adaptive fitness based not just on how many times they've been replicated, but on how much time you, the audience, have spent listening to them. Okay, I can see that I'm getting the signal that I'm out of time. Let me just say that if any of this is interesting to you, please, talk to me or my partner afterwards, or just come to our show on Friday, where you can see a lot of this play out in real time. Thank you."
