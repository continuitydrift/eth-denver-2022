# Chapter 8

"So you want a game that approximates reality," Babacar said.

"Yeah, or at least that leads to a process of historically accurate imagining that eventually could hone in on reality. Do you want to, like, open your laptop? I could type this more easily than I could explain it, and then this bus has wi-fi, we could just push a quick commit to github, or even just make a comment on the branch I started."

"No, I get car-sick. Besides, I want to look out the window. Open your laptop if you want to, but I'm not having a text chat with you when you're sitting right here."

Chase was silent for a while, not sulking, apparently, just thinking, trying to figure out the best move. Babacar smiled as Chase opened up his laptop, fiddling with the charger, typed for a while, and then closed it again, looking out the window.

"It's just a lot of money."

"The bounty?"

"No, forget about the bounty. This is worth more. Well, not technically, but you don't have to compete with hundreds of other teams for it. I already **have** the funding."

"How much?"

The forty-something year old white man looked around the bus dramatically, and then stage-whisepered, "Well, that was something I wanted to discuss privately." He even held up his hands and typed on an imaginary keyboard. Babacar disliked him even more.

Babacar took out his phone, and only broke eye contact to look up the number Marcus had given him, and type "how much?"

Marcus looked at his phone and, taking about ten seconds longer, typed something back.

Babacar looked. **A lot.** It said.

Their relationship had not begun auspiciously.

"Are you the pseudoghost?" The tanned white man had asked him.

"Seriously?" Babacar had said. He had been in a foul mood after weighing the chances of the trip to Breckenridge being worth the cost, in terms of future, speculative profit stacked against immediate expenses, and deciding against it. He just bought a plane ticket back to Portland. The whole collaborative fantasy of the conference had suddenly seemed like a sham, like the pyramid scheme that Bytecoin's critics had always said it was.

"Sorry. Babacar?"

Babacar had stared at the man, taking in the details of him, guessing his intentions. Either not hostile, or good at hiding it. Visions of game theory danced before his eyes, hawks and doves, hordes of cellular automata.


“I saw your presentation. I want to hire you. Just for the weekend.”

“It  seems like a terrible idea,” Babacar had said, later, when Chase had told him about the game.

“Why?”

“Okay, so you were saying that one faction of the original development team wanted to weigh the reincarnation probabilities in favor of prehistory, right? Hundreds of thousands of years, right up until we’re brushing stooped shoulders with the chimpanzees, right?”

“Or bonobos,” Chase said, “but sure.”

“Where did all of this early human history occur? What continent?”

“...Africa.”

“That’s right. Until a bunch of weirdos decided to colonize Eurasia, breeding with Neanderthals along the way.”

“What?”

“So, you were saying that the most rare NFTs would be those with reincarnations farthest back in time. The most valuable. And people would own these NFTs, which would give them the right to profit from anything that character did, in the metaverse? Do you start to see the problem?”

“Yeah,” Chase said. “Now that you say it that way. This game is a bad idea.” He looked out the window, thinking. Babacar almost took him seriously, until he unclipped his water tube from the shoulder-strap of his pack, and suck on it.
