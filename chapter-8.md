# Chapter 8

"So you want a game that approximates reality," Babacar said.

"Yeah, or at least that leads to a process of historically accurate imagining that eventually could hone in on reality. Do you want to, like, open your laptop, I could type this more easily than I could explain it, and then this bus has wi-fi, we could just push a quick commit to github, or even just make a comment on the branch I started."

"No, I get car-sick. Besides, I want to look out the window. Open your laptop if you want to, but I'm not having a text chat with you when you're sitting right here."

Chase was silent for a while, not sulking, apparently, just thinking, trying to figure out the best move. Babacar smiled as Chase opened up his laptop, fiddling with the charger, typed for a while, and then closed it again, looking out the window.

"It's just a lot of money."

"The bounty?"

"No, forget about the bounty. This is worth more. Well, not technically, but you don't have to compete with hundreds of other teams for it. I already **have** the funding."

"How much?"

The forty-something year old white man looked around the bus dramatically, and then stage-whisepered, "Well, that was something I wanted to discuss privately." He even held up his hands and typed on an imaginary keyboard. Babacar disliked him even more.

Babacar took out his phone, and only broke eye contact to look up the number Marcus had given him, and type "how much?"

Marcus looked at his phone and, taking about ten seconds longer, typed something back.

Babacar looked. **A lot.** It said.

Their relationship had not begun auspiciously.

"Are you the pseudoghost?" The tanned white man had asked him.

"Seriously?" Babacar had said. He had been in a foul mood after weighing the chances of the trip to Breckenridge being worth the cost, in terms of future, speculative profit weighed against immediate expenses, and deciding against it. He just bought a plane ticket back to Portland. Russia had invaded Ukraine in the middle of the night, and the whole collaborative fantasy of the conference had suddenly seemed like a sham, like the pyrmamid scheme that Bytecoin's critics had always said it was.

"Sorry. Babacar?"

Babacar had stared at the man, taking in the details of him, guessing his intentions. Either not hostile, or good at hiding it. Visions of game theory danced before his eyes, hawks and doves, hordes of cellular automata.
