I will be making the rolls for Chapter 9 this evening at 5:00 pm CST (approx six hours from time of posting)


The primary character will be determined by rolling 2d6

-1st: (roll of 6 or 7): Nico
-2nd: (roll of 8 or 9): Sunitha
-3rd: (roll of 4 or 5): Chase
-4th: (roll of 10 or 11): Matty
-5th: (roll of 2 or 3): Marcus
-6th: (roll of 12): Babacar

The second character will be determined by another roll, but starting from the hex of the primary charcter. If the indicated direction is off the hex table, it wraps around to the opposite side.
