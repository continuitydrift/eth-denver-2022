"Which side are you on?" Charles asked him, with that singer's voice pseudo-tremulous in weird auditory tones, like a low-pass filter in multiple dimensions. "Continuity or Drift?"

That had been the name of the novel he'd been reading on the train, the first time he'd met them, preoccupied with troubles that now seemed laughably small in comparison. Strangely, he felt calmer now than he had then.

He looked back over at Matty and Sunitha, and when he turned back to the couple, both of their eyes were focused like raptors on his friends. Or so it seemed, run through the cut-off filter the weird aphasia of not being able to read emotions in people's eyes. Why he trusted typing more than speech. There was music coming from somewhere. Sunitha's music, unless he was going crazy. Sunitha was at the table across the room, the artificial pool. It was coming from Bernie's phone.

She took it out and set it on the table, turning up the volume. "My nephew is something of a programmer himself. I told him about the Glider Guns and he added an improvement to the design. Now, the longer you let the phone ring, the higher of a fitness score it assigns in the sample in the...what did he call it, evolutionary landscape?"

That was actually a good idea, Chase thought. Bernie swiped the call closed, without looking at the phone to see who it was. "I apologize for the interruption. I believe my importunate beau was inquiring as to your allegiance in this fictional universe you have in common."

"Do you mind if I order a drink?" Chase asked. Charles raised his rather long eyebrows and the wait staff appeared so quickly behind Chase's shoulder that he almost jumped. The older couple first recommended a Tempranillo, and then insisted they put a bottle on their mutual tab.

"We're not driving anywhere tonight!" They laughed, almost like two tracks laid on top of each other. That was the thing Chase had, on first meeting them, read as the adorable familiarity of a long-term couple, but now, under this more sinister lighting, impressed him as some kind of forced, regimented coordination, although he couldn't tell which direction the fear or obedience flowed. Like they were members of the same cult. Telepathic. The kind of friends, fellow true believers, he'd never been able to make.

In the novel, there were two alternate dimensions. In one, aliens had already invaded. In another, they had not, but likely would. The plot revolved around two opposing viewpoints, originating in but not confined to the twin realities: that alien tech should be used to take over the still-human world to save it, and that the human world should not transform itself into something unrecognizable, on the mere possibility of an attack. Drift and Continuity.

"I was pretty sick when I was reading it on the train, to be honest," Chase said. A filled wine glass had somehow appeared next to him.

"What about the protests? Have you heard about them?" Charles was carving into a stake, rare enough for blood to leak out of the sides.

"My phone hasn't been charging," Chase said. "Same with a few other people, actually."

"Well, it is a hackathon after all," the older woman said, crunching on a salad.

"A build-a-thon, technically. We're building."

"What are you building?" Charles asked. "A meme?" Bernie put in.

"Chase," Matty said from behind him, making him jump again. "Would you mind introducing us? Sunitha recognized her music and wanted to thank them for downloading the NFT. She said it sounded like one of the expensive ones."

Introductions were made, and two more chairs were brought in. Matty asked about the wine, and then, somewhat rudely, took Chase's wine glass and stuck her nose in it, sniffing, not taking her eyes off of Bernie, for some reason. "Smells a little off," she said, and then, apparently by accident, setting it down out of Chase's reach.

"I heard you mention the protests, earlier, and something about the phones? Chase might have told you, I'm having trouble with mine, too. I'm worried because my family is on their way here, tonight. I need to be able to talk to them."

"We have a laptop if you want to use that," Charles offered, sympathy (probably?) in his eyes. Matty looked at him squarely for an uncomfortable length of time, and then leaned forward, putting her elbows on the table, and knocking over Chase's wine glass. The waitress magically appeared.

They poured him a new glass, washing out the first, and Matty seemed content, this time, to let him drink it.
