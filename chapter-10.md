# 10: Trolls

Babacar, it turned out, was a serious gamer, the possible intersection of NFTs and role playing games being the main reason he had attended the conference. Sunitha had, when she learned that he was planning on doing a regular Witch.tv broadcast, had encouraged him to let Marcus stream it on a different laptop, using Nico's decentralized app, and comparing the quality of the two streams and engagement.

So they were in a side-room off the main common area for the lodge, with one of the establishment's flat-screen tvs propped face up on the table, with a clear plastic mat protecting the display from the miniatures Babacar had pulled from a pouch of actual chainmail. Dice, drinks, and fried foods were featured prominently at the table margins not covered by the display.

Nico was the only one playing virtually, his video feed appearing in a corner of the horizontal screen. He'd dropped the flamingo avatar, and so far hadn't been using his daemonic filter, but his usual background of medieval bric-a-brac leant the stream a touch of authenticity, as did his accent.

Sunitha had a lot more followers than Babacar, so she started her own stream on Witch, looping some instrumentals with the new instruments, the acoustics surprisingly decent. "Welcome," she said, looking into the camera that Marcus had set up, far better resolution than the web cam or phone she usually used. She had decent microphones and recording equipment back in Baltimore, but had never considered upgrading her video quality worth the cost.

"I'm in Colorado, with some friends I made in the past week, and of course Sunil, who will be doing the audio for this stream, and Babacar, who'll be running a one-shot of his original procedural role playing game, Septagons." Marcus was running the broadcasting software, and he switched it to the angle showing Babacar, smiling more than any time since she'd met him a few days ago. Sunitha, as much as she tried to suppress it, felt an automatic dislike for Marcus. They'd tried jamming, and it was clear that despite his claim to know some "killer solos" on guitar, he had no idea how to improvise or listen to other musicians. His musical tastes (surf rock, for god's sake!) indicated an ability to only enjoy over-produced and predictable formulas of chord changes and folksy slides and hammer-ons.

"Septagon's is a working title, Sunitha. Thank's for hosting this on your channel, and welcome to anyone joining us from over there. I can see already we have more people here than usual." He proceeded to greet, by name, anyone who said hello in the chat. It was the one thing Sunitha didn't like about streaming, the expectation to acknowledge every person in the audience who bothered to type an emoji. The quality of the stream decreased for everyone because of the time wasted validating the presence of every single viewer, which led to fewer viewers. A self-regulating system. Homeostatic balancing of interest.

At some point, Marcus switched the camera over to her again, and eventually Babacar took the hint, although they were using one hot mic in the middle of the table, so there was no way for the snowboarder to actually mute him.

"We should thank Ski-foot lodge, too," Sunitha said as a waitress came in with a pot of black tea. "Send Bytecoin to the address I'm posting in chat and they will get it in tips. If you want to tip us, the Glider Guns, use the link in the description. Just don't tell Benton or Craig, or we'll have to give them a cut. Just kidding, guys, I see you in chat. I think we're ready when you are." The last she said to Babacar, who was fiddling with dice and the large sheets of hexagonal graph paper he'd spread out in front of him, weighed down by drinks and coasters.

Half of music, Sunitha thought, was listening to the other players, and taking turns. It was the same, she observed, with role playing games. Marcus, as boorish as he was in actual conversation and when he played guitar, showed an unsuspected ability to respond, rather than to act, when he was playing with cameras and directing the stream. He was also one of the players, but didn't speak out of turn, or maintain the vague aura of aloof superiority he always seemed to carry about him.

Everyone, Sunitha thought, had this mask of themselves that they slipped into. She was tempted to think of online personas, the live-action avatars digital natives and the remote-schooled had been forced to adopt, as a generational thing, but Marcus was middle-aged, and Nico, the boomer, seemed more adept at metaversal self-presentation than any of them. Chase, too, surprisingly, relaxed into the game, and the rule-based rhythms of sharing dice rolls and screen time. His faux-british accept was on-point, and the pseudo-autistic energies he normally gave off melted into his character. Some people were just running their reality-processors too fast, overheating, and needed either substances or stories to slow them down enough to interact without jittery self-consciousness.

She, like Sunil, were straight-edge, trying to achieve with mental awareness and attention what others short-cut into with alcohol or drugs. Except for weed, of course, and the occasional micro-dose of psilocybin, as was the case tonight.

"You need to roll against an intellect challenge of 5," Babacar was saying. "On a miss, we go into combat. On a weak hit, you also have to fight the cultist, but you start with an advantage."

Sunitha, thankfully, had mostly been in charge of the music, she and Sunil filling in lulls in the action, when Babacar and Chase had started arguing about the rules. Her character, fittingly, had been a bard, and Sunil even made rolls as a tight-lipped thief. Marcus, when not contributing basic white-boy guitar licks, or adding experimental filters to the video feed, played a straight-forward barbarian, with an "axe" (ha, ha).

While the game was going on, there were also a few hundred participants in chat to keep track of. "Hey, Nico," Sunitha messaged him. "Are you seeing the assholes in chat?"

"Yes, my dear," Nico wrote back. "I have a bot that might help."

Sunitha tried not to blame Marcus, or Chase. Sunil, technically, should have been moderating, but he was too wrapped up in the audio. There was a direct line of association, regrettably, between crypto communities and libertarian dim-wits.

They had started it, arguably, with the content of the board game, which, on the surface was a simple fantasy-realm dungeon crawl, but quickly devolved into thinly-veiled moralizing about different blockchains, and geo-political tensions. When people had started posting links to support the trucker protests in Canada, it had seemed part of the same tongue-in-cheek, under-the-radar exchange of coded language that was all in good fun. Once started, though, it quickly got out of hand.

Some of the things people said made her heart skip a beat, and she thought about shutting off the stream, since she was hosting it on the Glider Guns channel. Then: screw it. This was her stream, and if there was ever a place to fight these idiots, and shut them down, it was here.

While Babacar and Chase developed an elaborate backstory between a NPC and his axe-wielding hero, Sunitha and Nico went to war against the brigade of trolls that was trying to take over the stream. A user named "pseudoghost" entered the chat, a bot with moderating privileges, and proceeded to not only delete comments faster than Sunitha could read them, but absolutely destroy the libertarian blow-hards with mockery and logic. It had to be a real person, Sunitha thought.

The Glider Guns fans cheered on the bot, linking to sites where they could vote for it in any number of running contests. "The pseudoghost," Nico wrote as daemonic_platypus, "is the first anti-racist and anti-authoritarian bot developed by Reincarnate labs." A bot command brought up yet another link, to a hundred-plus page whitepaper.

Babacar, finally catching on, worked the pseudoghost and the trolls into the story, leaving, at the three hour mark, on a cliff-hanger, even though it was supposed to be a one-shot.

"I had tons of fun tonight," Babacar said. "I'll have to check with everyone, but maybe we could do a part two a week from now?"
