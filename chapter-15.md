No one was hurt, physically or severely.

Matty did believe, as Chase, Dana, and Babacar saw, that her family was burning, inside their car. She couldn't get close enough to tell, and while no one restrained her, several people shouted at her not to walk into the flames. It was, more than their voices, the heat that stopped her.

And then Brian, his hand on her elbow, then, when she faced him, both of his arms around her. Jenny and Ras.

When they were sure no one was hurt, the band started playing again, taking the time between songs to point anyone who might be showing signs of post traumatic shock towards the triage tent backstage (a camping tent someone had pitched just outside the driver's side door of their tour bus).

They asked her questions, and she must have answered them. She felt telepathic, able to sense their aliveness without seeing or hearing them, super-attuned to their existence after, for a world-altering minute, believing they were gone.

"Matty," Chase said, looking guiltily at her family. "Nico wants to talk to you."

Nico felt like he was dying. He was, of course, but more slowly than his body seemed to be telling him this morning.

Virtual reality was like a drug, and coming off of it was worse than the discomfort that had driven him to an artificial means of temporary escape. He was a prisoner of his flesh, but able, with his goggles, to astrally project, to become a ghost before his time. Half a ghost.

Matty's tear-smeared face looked down into the screen. Nico was in a bathrobe, which he made sure was decently fastened around his waist. For a terrified second, he thought he still had the flamingo filter on.

"What do you know about this?" Matty asked him.

"I saw the drone feed," Nico said, rubbing his eyes, "and Marcus's live stream. I've been talking to Chase, and the rest of the DAO. It wasn't Chase that set off the bombs. The trail that has been planted, showing a call between his phone and a device planted in the trucks, tells a different story."

He'd just woken up. Had been dealing with the escalation of the conflict between the two factions to a hot war, although one, so far, without casualties.

Matty, he could tell, was a person familiar with how quickly history could happen. How the rug of cultural and psychological continuity could be pulled from out of your feet, burned into chaotic dust.

"Are you leaving?" He asked, thinking about the footage of her, clinging to her husband and kids. He really did believe that whoever set off the bombs wouldn't have set off the explosion, or let Chase set it off, if there had been a chance of people nearby. That meant whoever had sent the signal was either in the crowd, or had access to the drone footage.

"No. My family is. I'm going to stay and figure out who did this. I'm going to nail them with it. Even if it's one of ours."

"It isn't." Nico said.
