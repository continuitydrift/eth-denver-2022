# Chapter 5

The Taproom, like so many of the bars in Denver, had the feel and smell of a ski lodge, except instead of a fireplace they had a pizza oven. It took him a second to find Damien, at a small table by the wall, under an oil painting of the Western slope of La Plata Peak, autumn aspens in the foreground. Damien looked up from his laptop, through those weird lenses that were supposed to lessen eye-strain from screens. Without thinking, they clasped hands, pulling each other into a chest-thumping hug, mindful of the beer and cheesy fries on the table.

After a long day of acting fake around strangers, or around strangers that felt like they were being fake to him, Marcus was glad to see his friend, to be able to sit without watching what he said. Their little rituals washed him in a relaxing buzz, before he had even started drinking. "What'd you get?" Marcus asked.

"Altitude," Damien said. It was one of his favorite pale ale's, from a local micro-brew.

"Want another?"

His friend considered. "Nah, not yet. Let me nurse this one. The altitude really does make it stronger." It was a little joke they'd both made many times.

When Marcus came back with a beer of his own, Damien asked what he thought of the conference. "Other than getting fired."

"Remember that anime thing you dragged me to in Boulder when you were obsessed with that show?"

"Taiku 7. Yeah, it was otakucon, sophmore year. Stacy Maples got you to cosplay as Kitatus."

"Just because she made the costume, and offered to do the make-up. And because she, you know."

Damien grinned, some fries still stuck in his teeth. "Had a huge crush on you?"

"Yeah. Well, this conference reminds me of that, but with more nerds, and less hot women. No," he said, knowing he couldn't offend Damien, "it's like all those freaks now have tons of money, and see all their cringey collectible crap as *investments*". They clinked glasses, and both took gulps and made contented sighs.

"Huh. Accurate. Speaking, of freaky nerds, I was wondering if you could talk to someone, while I do this for a few minutes." He gestured vaguely at the laptop. "Someone I'm working with. In Luxembourg. Told him about you, and he's curious."

"Are you serious? You're...outsourcing having a conversation with me?"

"Just for a few minutes. I promise, he's cool. Then I'll spot us another round."

"Whatever," Marcus said as Damien propped up a tablet to face him, handing him some wireless headphones. The man was already on the screen by the time he got them over his ears, dampening the sounds of the bar.

The man on the call was older than Marcus was expecting, with thinning white hair down to the shoulders of his dinner jacket. He was either using a well-rendered background, or was seated in a study that wouldn't have been out of place in a medieval castle, with high oak cabinets and bookshelves, queen Anne chairs, tapestries, and even actual candles in holders and glass hoods, their light softening the glow of the screen Damien's friend was looking into. The only thing out of place was a modern scupture cast in bronze, mounted on the wall. Marcus wouldn't have been at all surprised to see a skull on the table, or a quill pen and bottle of ink.

"Ah! You are drinking! Please, let me join you." His accent didn't sound German so much as Eastern European, with a touch of vampire. There was the sound of pouring off=screen, and then a big stein filled the view.

"Noroc!" the man said.

"Cheers."

"My name is Nico," he said, wiping froth from his moustache. "This is Trappist beer, from an actual monestary. I wish I could share it with you!"

"Marcus. And thank you. I don't think I've ever had it."

"A pity. Yes, Marcus, Damien has told me about you. You are at the conference, too, no?"
