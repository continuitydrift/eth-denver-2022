# 1: Virus

"I'm a memeticist," Chase said. The older couple blinked at him, one and then the other, a habit that they must have developed over years of marriage, and now mirrored unconsciously.

You could hack facial recognition software to output when a person was blinking. It wouldn't be that hard: if the outline was a round profile, no nose or lips, you would probably also be able to see the corneal rings or whatever. If you couldn't, that meant their eyes were closed. Then plot blink rates like a cardiogram. People might end up having unique blink signatures, something that could be used for identification even if they were wearing a mask.

"Well that's interesting," the man said, making non-committal sounds while his wife squinted and smiled with an almost similar expression, perpetually looking into some Midwestern sunset, even when it was dark outside, and they were under the unflattering luminescence of the dining car.

Chase struggled to remember their names, while waiting for the man to complete the long pause between "you're a..." and remembering what he'd just told them, "a meta-cyst?"

"Memecist," he said, genuinely amused. "No wait, memeticist. Now you have me doing it."

"What does a memeticist do?" The woman asked, wiping cream cheese off the plastic table with a napkin, without breaking eye contact. He tried not to think about germs.

There was the surface level conversation, and then the whole subterranean significance of unconscious signals. Like with a lot of things, evolution had favored focus on the eyes. Dilation of pupil indicating interest or attention, how much the muscles around the sockets were engaging in conjunction with the mouth. He'd read about how prominent limbal rings were attractive because they were reliable indicators of youth, tending to get obscured by cataracts or glaucomas later in life.

"I'm headed to that conference in Denver. The Truthereum conference? I...was a researcher. Now I sort of freelance. I'm part of a DAO. Well, I'm applying."

More non-committal noises. He was losing them. By the glance they exchanged he could almost hear their pre-emptive "well, anyway" preliminary to a polite exit. They'd only started talking because the man, Charles (that was it!) had commented on the book he'd been reading, an old pulp science fiction novel he'd picked up from a used bookstore. It had been recommended by the DAO, and probably would have been published when this guy was in his twenties, so it made sense he'd recognized it. He also remembered the plot, and main characters.

"You said you were in finance?"

"Oh, that's a fancy term for it," the man said, looking briefly out the window as they passed the dopplering lights of a rural station. "Bernie's family is in the shipping business. I'm a regional manager, in Minnesota."

"I work as a school nurse, now that the kids are grown. Charles is also a singer. Back in his prime, he recorded with the Ministring Orchestra. Show him your bass note, honey."

Charles obliged, opening wide as if to belch, making a sound deeper than the rumbling of the train.

Back in his seat, his phone precariously balanced on the armrest in the only configuration where the dirty usb port would actually take a charge, Chase felt sick. The sadness that had temporarily abated once he'd made the decision to go to the conference returned, stronger than before. He caught himself grinding his teeth, a maddening fragment of melody looping through his head.

The idea of being on a train had appealed to him in imagination, although a flight would have been easier, and he wouldn't be missing the first two days of the hackathon. *You're on the right track*, the train had seemed to say, pulling out of Union Station, after his father had dropped him off.

He'd planned on working while on the train, getting started on looking at the libraries he would use. Chase wouldn't be able to do the coding himself. He'd be the idea guy, doing the docs, maybe giving a presentation, a philosophical framing. Assuming he could find a team. Rather than working, he had scrolled through Flitter and the Accord servers for the hackathon and the Daemon DAO, increasingly jealous of other people's bios and skills, feeling like an imposter.

After an initial surge of approval and positive emojis, interest in his post about memetic theory and NFT metadata had dried up. He'd burned his bridges with the two developers he'd been planning on working with virtually, from England and Estonia. The rules didn't allow for mixed teams of in-person and virtual attendees. He'd banked on finding another, even better team for the on-site hackathon, competing for a different set of bounties. So far, though, no one wanted to work with him. *We can talk about it when you get here* more than one developer had said, but there was a limit of four people on a team, and the teams were filling up.

The train had stopped, the conductor saying something about needing to scrape ice off the tracks. Chase couldn't tell if he was joking. Outside was impenetrable dark, save a slight downward static of snow. A mother was yelling at her toddler, who was crawling under the seats, among the shells of sunflower seeds and coffee cups. Counting down through clenched teeth.

When she got to two, Chase stood up and stumbled down to the bathrooms.

His stomach wasn't upset because of his emotions, Chase realized with the clarity of deep physical distress. The arrow of causality went the other way. His mood of doom had come from being sick, some rogue replicator in his gut. The virus didn't cause diarrhea, did it? No, this was something else, probably the unrefrigerated seaweed salad from the noodle place two days ago. Not sure if the fizzy expulsions from his colon were over, after wiping the worst of it, he looked at his phone.

Crypto was still down. Two more people had liked his comment on Reader. No one had responded to his pitch, except to post a meme which Chase didn't get, some bear head in front of a pinwheel of colors, a radial blur of motion. God he hated memes.

Looking at the comments, he thought of another reason why he might be feeling so terrible. It was the first night in years that he wasn't drinking.
