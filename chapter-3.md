# Chapter 3

It felt good to be part of a team. Marcus hadn't had anything resembling a normal job since working at a fish shack in high school, and if he was going to jump back into gainful employment in his 40s, coming in from the cold, this seemed like the least selling-outway to do it. These Goalrand people were legit. In a way, it was coming full circle. Damien had gotten him into crypto back in college, perhaps as a way to pay Marcus back for getting him laid.

They'd been an unlikely duo, a surfer from Cali and a computer nerd from Ohio, but they'd shared a love of hikes in the mountains. Both loners, they were so far out of each other's social circles that spending time with each other was almost like being alone.

Their bromance had blossomed, for three out of the four years at Colorado University, until senior year, where they each had dived too far into their respective interests, snowboarding and programming, for the other to follow.

They kept in touch, though, and Marcus had bought a few thousand dollars worth of Bytecoin, and later bought ten thousand, giving the keys to Damien, to invest however he saw fit. Just like Damien trusted him to find their way back on overnight camping trips, or to not get them killed on the boundary waters, Marcus had trusted his friend to do that "crypto stuff," knowing he would be able to surf the waves of risk and innovation far better than he.

Marcus didn't understand how it worked, but the profit his friend took from the investments, combined with money his parents had given him on graduation, allowed him to do almost nothing for fifteen years other than make snowboarding videos and go through three different marriages, supporting two kids. He'd even lived for a while in the French Alps, following the third wife to the Swiss side, learning a little bit of three different languages.

In 2018 Damien had sent him an email telling him he'd cashed out all of his Bytecoin. He'd lost 40 percent of his remaining investment, but he should consider himself lucky. Marcus trusted him. He'd gotten to know a little bit about the Swiss banking system, and had a nest egg that Damien didn't know about.

A year later, in Yosemite, eating beans that Damien had made (that was the one part of camping Marcus always left to him), his friend had told him that the rest of the money had been invested in Truthereum, and had gone up 200%. Marcus had come back to the States for his mother's funeral, and because Elana was filing for divorce, and custody of their daughter. He'd gotten to know the Swiss legal system, far better than he would have liked.

Six months ago, on a ski lift, Damien had told him that he'd sold all of Marcus's Truthereum, and invested it in Goalrand, the token of the foundation he was working for. There was a corporation and a foundation, and his job was some kind of a liason between the two. Goalrand was faster, cheaper, and more carbon neutral than Truthereum, and had goal-oriented proof of stake, supposedly superior to the thousands of other cryptographic schemes to solve problems of security and scalability.

Marcus, at that point, had almost none of his own money left, after medical bills, child support, and a tax audit. Damien had told him he could find him a job, despite his only skills being a dubious ability to produce and edit snowboarding videos, and playing heavy metal licks on guitar.
