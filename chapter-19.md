Matty was glad to be back home, swept back into her daily rounds of professional and familial life, her home office invaded by cats and children, who only interrupted her for *very important* things approximately ever ten minutes. The houseplants had needed watering, and Brian had forgotten to take the trash out on Tuesday, but other than that things had been fine without her. They'd gotten their mini-vacation, with horse-back riding and snow-tubing, and she'd joined them on the last day, when it was clear she wasn't going to figure anything more out about the explosion, or the young mens' encounter with the masked environmentalists.

The morning after, she'd gone to the yoga session with Dana after all, and shown her the photo on her phone. Matty knew that she was active in the group whose symbol had been sprayed on the logging truck.

"Oh my God," Dana had said when she saw the image. "There's no way anyone from our group would have done that."

"I know," Matty sighed. "It has to be some sick *provocateurs*. But still, they knew were connected to the protests, right?" Dana had hesitated. "Look, I know no real activists would have done this, but did you hear any talk, anyone new, trying to push people to protest the clear cutting, or the conference?" They'd been in a basement room of the lodge, underneath heavy wooden rafters, standing by prints of different animal tracks. Dana had looked around, nervously.

"Yeah, there were some people we'd never seen before. Smart, but overbearing, talking about how terrible the logging near the peak was, which didn't make any sense, because everyone knew it was just for fire suppression, but the kept saying 'trees should be cut down just to save some yuppie resort. We should burn it down ourselves.'"

"And the conference?"

"Same thing. Arguments that made no sense about how much energy Bytecoin mining uses, how bad NFTs are for the environment."

The irony, now that she was safely home in Columbus, and going through the projects submitted for the virtual hackathon, was that most of them were projects related to conservation, either rewarding carbon capture, planting trees, or cleaning trash out of the oceans.

One submission, called Prophets, was a way for players to predict real-world events related to politics or environmental collapse, betting on things like a blue ocean event or cascading extinctions and biodiversity loss. Bets were placed on when economies would collapse, wars break out, or pandemics erupt. The better your track record in making predictions, the higher you were ranked, and other players could mirror your bets, effectively investing in you as an oracle or prophet. Unlike with news media or professional prognosticators, the game actually remembered and rewarded or punished past predictions based on their accuracy. Beta testers had, with surprising accuracy, predicted the war in Ukraine, and even things like draughts or typhoons, with surprising accuracy, leveraging the wisdom of crowds.

In their acknowledgments, the team thanked the Daemon DAO. Matty decided to give Nico a call.

It was morning in Luxembourg, and she was alarmed to see Nico in a wheelchair, covered in a warm-looking quilt, but relieved to see him surrounded by a group of young people, busily typing on keyboards or talking intensely over screens. Of course, she thought, he would have a local team, probably one he had used as a model for the groups he was trying to form elsewhere.

He confirmed her guess. "Yes, this is the Prophets team. Reincarnate is the DAOs attempt to incentivize crowd-sourced research and imagination into the past, and Prophets is doing the same thing, but for the future." Both games, despite their simplicity and functionality, had a whiff of something morbid, or immoral. A touch of brimstone. Maybe, though, things really could be the opposite of the sign they traveled under. The Dark Spirals site had reversed their rating for the Daemon DAO, noting that the entry had been flagged for likely manipulation and false reports. Evidence of bot-swarms, forming their own dark spiral or collapsing information, had been detected. Her own investigation, when she suspected them of blowing up the truck, and threatening Chase, had showed them to be secretive, but mostly good.

The old couple from the restaurant, though, were a different story. They were on the board of several think tanks, shell companies, and lobbying groups connected with, among other things, the prosecution of a human rights lawyer who had successful sued oil companies in Ecuador for poisoning rivers in the amazon. He'd been disbarred, and under house arrest for two years, sentenced by a judge for contempt of court for refusing to turn over evidence in an obviously spurious case of fraud. Charles really had been a professional singer, but was now the CEO of a transportation company know for hiring private security forces to harass pipeline protestors in Canada and the US. he had also, disturbingly, been at a land rights auction where activists had delayed the purchase of fracking and logging leases by pretending to be wealthy bidders. Two of the environmentalists had been found to have been near-fatally poisoned with Strychnine.

"I don't get it, though," Matty said to Nico when the conversation turned to the events at the Snow-foot. They seemed a little off, but not *evil*. I'm sure, though, I saw the woman put something in Chase's drink. How can anyone lose their way that badly?"

"We did a little digging of our own," Nico said. "We found out the singer has a son, who was studying music and literature in St. Petersburg. He hasn't been back to the U.S. in years, but the Conservatory there says he dropped out of the program." Nico said something in Luxembourgish to a young woman, tan and thin, who nodded, grabbing something the bookshelf behind him, next to the framed painting of a flamingo.

"Would some oil baron oligarch really go through all that, just to crash the price of Truthereum, or to prevent Chase from working on some kind of memetic program?"

Nico shrugged, pouring himself tea, squeezing a lemon over the cup. "The world is too complex for any individual, any one point of view or mind, to make sense of. It is chaos beyond the control of the grey matter stuffed in any one skull, and those who try inevitably become tyrants, and forces of death. Centralized technologies and governments will inevitably fall. We're just trying to make sure they don't take the entire species, or biosphere, down with them. That's why Reincarnate and Prophets are trying to use collective intelligence to tap into the oceanic wisdom of crowds, washing away all these petty remnants of colonial empires."

"To summon a daemon."

Nico beamed. "Exactly."

"You know I can't vote for our project, right?"

"Of course, my dear. We weren't really competing. We just wanted you to have a chance to read about our project."

Marcus had driven Sunitha and Sunil to the airport, and then he and Babacar said goodbye to Chase, who would be staying at Marcus's house while he was gone. Marcus was driving to Red Rocks, to meet up with the band and the entourage of roadies that had thrown such a good party in the middle of a snowy road, even after the two trucks had exploded behind the stage.

"I guess it didn't happen, did it?" Marcus asked in the parking lot, pulling Babacar's suitcase from the trunk.

"What didn't happen?"

"The thing with Chase. Whatever the Russians or oil companies were trying to prevent. The merge, or summoning, or whatever."

Babacar looked into his eyes, trying to see how much he was joking. "I guess not. Although things do feel...different somehow." Marcus nodded, humming a line of music. They said goodbye, and Marcus went in for a hug, Babacar returning it awkwardly, the suitcase between them.

In the station, all the lights flickered, and then came back on.

A young woman came up to him, looking between him and her phone, uncertainly.
