Matty was glad to be back home, swept back into her daily rounds of professional and familial life, her home office invaded by cats and children, who only interrupted her for *very important* things approximately ever ten minutes. The houseplants had needed watering, and Brian had forgotten to take the trash out on Tuesday, but other than that things had been fine without her. They'd gotten their mini-vacation, with horse-back riding and snow-tubing, and she'd joined them on the last day, when it was clear she wasn't going to figure anything more out about the explosion, or the young mens' encounter with the masked environmentalists.

The morning after, she'd gone to the yoga session with Dana after all, and shown her the photo on her phone. Matty knew that she was active in the group whose symbol had been sprayed on the logging truck.

"Oh my God," Dana had said when she saw the image. "There's no way anyone from our group would have done that."

"I know," Matty sighed. "It has to be some sick *provocateurs*. But still, they knew were connected to the protests, right?" Dana had hesitated. "Look, I know no real activists would have done this, but did you hear any talk, anyone new, trying to push people to protest the clear cutting, or the conference?" They'd been in a basement room of the lodge, underneath heavy wooden rafters, standing by prints of different animal tracks. Dana had looked around, nervously.

"Yeah, there were some people we'd never seen before. Smart, but overbearing, talking about how terrible the logging near the peak was, which didn't make any sense, because everyone knew it was just for fire suppression, but the kept saying 'trees should be cut down just to save some yuppie resort. We should burn it down ourselves.'"

"And the conference?"

"Same thing. Arguments that made no sense about how much energy Bytecoin mining uses, how bad NFTs are for the environment."

The irony, now that she was safely home in Columbus, and going through the projects submitted for the virtual hackathon, was that most of them were projects related to conservation, either rewarding carbon capture, planting trees, or cleaning trash out of the oceans.

One submission, called Oracles, was a way for players to predict real-world events related to politics or environmental collapse, betting on things like a blue ocean event or cascading extinctions and biodiversity loss. Bets were placed on when economies would collapse, wars break out, or pandemics erupt. The better your track record in making predictions, the higher you were ranked, and other players could mirror your bets, effectively investing in you as an oracle. Unlike with news media or professional prognosticators, the game actually remembered and rewarded or punished past predictions based on their accuracy. Beta testers had, with surprising accuracy, predicted the war in Ukraine, and even things like draughts or typhoons, with surprising accuracy, leveraging the wisdom of crowds.

In their acknowledgments, the team thanked the Daemon DAO. Matty decided to give Nico a call.

It was morning in Luxembourg, and she was alarmed to see Nico in a wheelchair, covered in a warm-looking quilt, but relieved to see him surrounded by a group of young people, busily typing on keyboards or talking intensely over screens. Of course, she thought, he would have a local team, probably one he had used as a model for the groups he was trying to form elsewhere.
