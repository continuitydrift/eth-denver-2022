# 19: The Bear

Matty was glad to be back home, swept back into her daily rounds of professional and familial life, her home office invaded by cats and children, who only interrupted her for *very important* things approximately ever ten minutes. The houseplants had needed watering, and Brian had forgotten to take the trash out on Tuesday, but other than that things had been fine without her. They'd gotten their mini-vacation, with horse-back riding and snow-tubing, and she'd joined them on the last day, when it was clear she wasn't going to figure anything more out about the explosion, or the young men's encounter with the masked environmentalists.

The morning after, she'd gone to the yoga session with Dana after all, and shown her the photo on her phone. Matty knew that she was active in the group whose symbol had been sprayed on the logging truck.

"Oh my God," Dana had said when she saw the image. "There's no way anyone from our group would have done that."

"I know," Matty sighed. "It has to be some sick *provocateurs*. But still, they knew were connected to the protests, right?" Dana had hesitated. "Look, I know no real activists would have done this, but did you hear any talk, anyone new, trying to push people to protest the clear cutting, or the conference?" They'd been in a basement room of the lodge, underneath heavy wooden rafters, standing by prints of different animal tracks. Dana had looked around, nervously.

"Yeah, there were some people we'd never seen before. Smart, but overbearing, talking about how terrible the logging near the peak was, which didn't make any sense, because everyone knew it was just for fire suppression, but the kept saying 'trees should be cut down just to save some yuppie resort. We should burn it down ourselves.'"

"And the conference?"

"Same thing. Nonsensical arguments about how much energy Bytecoin mining uses, how bad NFTs are for the environment."

The irony, now that she was safely home in Columbus, and going through the projects submitted for the virtual hackathon, was that most of them were projects related to conservation, either rewarding carbon capture, planting trees, or cleaning trash out of the oceans.

One submission, called Prophets, was a way for players to predict real-world events related to politics or environmental collapse, betting on things like a blue ocean event or cascading extinctions and biodiversity loss. Bets were placed on when economies would collapse, wars break out, or pandemics erupt. The better your track record in making predictions, the higher you were ranked, and other players could mirror your bets, effectively investing in you as an oracle or prophet. Unlike with news media or professional prognosticators, the game actually remembered, and rewarded or punished, past predictions based on their accuracy. Beta testers had, with surprising accuracy, predicted the war in Ukraine, draughts and typhoons, and petroleum prices, leveraging the wisdom of crowds.

In their acknowledgments, the team thanked the Daemon DAO. Matty decided to give Nico a call.

It was morning in Luxembourg, and she was alarmed to see Nico in a wheelchair, covered in a warm-looking quilt, but relieved he was surrounded by a group of young people, busily typing on keyboards or talking intensely over screens. Of course, she thought, he would have a local team, probably one he had used as a model for the groups he was trying to form elsewhere.

He confirmed her guess. "Yes, this is the Prophets team. Reincarnate is the DAOs attempt to incentivize crowd-sourced research and imagination into the past, and Prophets is doing the same thing, but for the future." Both games, despite their simplicity and functionality, had a whiff of something morbid, or immoral. A touch of brimstone. Maybe, though, things really could be the opposite of the sign they traveled under. The Dark Spirals site had reversed their rating for the Daemon DAO, noting that the entry had been flagged for likely manipulation and false reports. Evidence of bot-swarms, forming their own dark spiral or collapsing information. Her research, when she suspected them of blowing up the truck, and threatening Chase, had showed them to be secretive, but mostly beneficent.

The old couple from the restaurant were a different story. They were on the board of several think tanks, shell companies, asset managers and lobbying groups connected with, among other things, the prosecution of a human rights lawyer who had successfully sued oil companies in Ecuador for poisoning rivers. He'd been disbarred, and under house arrest for two years, sentenced by a judge for contempt of court for refusing to turn over evidence in an obviously spurious case of fraud. Charles really had been a professional singer, but was now the CEO of a transportation company know for hiring private security forces to harass pipeline protestors in Canada and the US. he had also, disturbingly, been at a land rights auction where activists had delayed the purchase of fracking and logging leases by pretending to be wealthy bidders. Two of the environmentalists had been found to have been near-fatally poisoned with Strychnine.

"I don't get it, though," Matty said to Nico when the conversation turned to the events at the Snow-foot. They seemed a little off, but not *evil*. I'm sure, though, I saw the woman put something in Chase's drink. How can anyone lose their way that badly?"

"We did a little digging of our own," Nico said. "We found out the singer has a son, who was studying music and literature in St. Petersburg. He hasn't been back to the U.S. in years, but the Conservatory there says he dropped out of the program." Nico said something in Luxembourgish to a young woman, tan and thin, who nodded, grabbing something the bookshelf behind him, next to the framed painting of a flamingo.

"Would some oil baron oligarch really go through all that, just to crash the price of Truthereum, or to prevent Chase from working on some kind of memetic program?"

Nico shrugged, pouring himself tea, squeezing a lemon over the cup. "The world is too complex for any individual, any one point of view or mind, to make sense of. It is chaos beyond the control of the grey matter stuffed in any one skull, and those who try inevitably become tyrants, and forces of death. Centralized technologies and governments will inevitably fall. We're just trying to make sure they don't take the entire species, or biosphere, down with them. That's why Reincarnate and Prophets are trying to use collective intelligence to tap into the oceanic wisdom of crowds, washing away all these petty remnants of colonial empires."

"To summon a daemon."

Nico beamed. "Exactly."

"You know I can't vote for your project, right?"

"Of course, my dear. We weren't really competing."

Marcus had driven Sunitha and Sunil to the airport, and then he and Babacar said goodbye to Chase, who would be staying at Marcus's house while he was gone. Marcus was driving to Red Rocks, to meet up with the band and the entourage of roadies that had thrown such a good party in the middle of a snowy road, even after the two trucks had exploded behind the stage.

"I guess it didn't happen, did it?" Marcus asked in the parking lot, pulling Babacar's suitcase from the trunk.

"What didn't happen?"

"The thing with Chase. Whatever the Russians or oil companies were trying to prevent. The merge, or summoning, or whatever."

Babacar looked into his eyes, trying to see how much he was joking. "I guess not. Although things do feel...different somehow." Marcus nodded, humming a line of music. There was the unexplained phenomena of the crypto prices dropping, for them, hours before the rest of the world. They said goodbye, and Marcus went in for a hug, Babacar returning it awkwardly, the suitcase between them.

In the station, all the lights flickered, and then came back on.

A young woman came up to him, looking between him and her phone, uncertainly.

"I'm sorry," she said. "Are you the pseudoghost?"

Chase was sitting in Marcus's kitchen, looking at the kitschy souvenirs on the walls. He envied Marcus's life: his kids (even if, as it seemed, Marcus rarely got to see them), his obvious wealth, and his travels. Pierrot, the bull-dog, had finished with his food, been taken out to pee, and was now asleep on his mat in the corner.

Chase opened an Altitude IPA, telling himself he would only drink one more tonight. Maybe two. He was listening to an EcoGloom podcast, some author who was talking about the 60 trillion metric tonnes of topsoil that had been lost in the American midwest, and how reliant agro-industries were on petroleum-based fertilizer. Organic nutrients could only be replaced by animal or vegetable matter, and the animals and plants had all been cleared away to make room for mono-cropped farms that pulled food from the soil, but gave nothing back. Combined with global warming, the guest was saying, and the salinization of low-lying coastal regions, the planet was looking at mass starvation, displacement, and conflict in the near future.

He was also listening, in a different window, to a recording of the Glider Guns from the night of the explosions, the surreal mash-up with melodies Sunil had told him had been partly generated from the falling market tickers (since recovered). He was also skimming the Daemon DAO Accord, the new channels he now had access to. Still, his mind was restless, needing something else to feed on. His phone was low, but as he was about to go plug it in, the lights flickered and died, along with his laptop, since the battery had, a while ago, stopped holding any charge. They came back on for a second, then went off again. The refrigerator had stopped humming, and the dog was looking up at him, staring into his eyes.

He'd talked to Sunitha the night before, thanking her for being so open with him, explaining about his inability to read the expressions in people's eyes. "That's normal," Sunitha had said. "It's the human condition. There's this French theorist I did a paper on. His famous line was, '*I don't know, and you can't tell me.*' He was talking about his ability as a writer, but it applies to everything. How other people think, how they feel about you. You can never know for sure, not from their eyes, their words, or anything else. Everyone is essentially inscrutable. The only thing different about you is that it bothers you. You *want* to know for sure, to understand what people think. You haven't given up. That's your meme, the replicator. Knowing you don't know, but wanting to. Please, don't ever let that go."

Chase went out onto the front porch, to see if the lights were out in the other houses. They were, although the street lights were still on. There was a package near the door, fairly large, and when Chase brought it back inside, using the light on his phone, he was surprised to see that it was addressed to him. He opened it, and pulled out a large felt mask, not as cartoonish as the others he remembered, of a bear.

He sat it on the kitchen table, opening another beer, and looked at it for a long time in the eerie silence, staring into its eyes.
