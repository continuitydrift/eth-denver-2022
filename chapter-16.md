Sunitha remembered obsessing over older girls, the way they talked. Later, it would be professors, or tech millionaires. The thing, she realized, that had given her an almost sacred fire of jealously, of wanting to be in that inner circle, the formula she had never been able to understand, was the opposite of a formula. There was no algorithm or structure that could be followed or reproduced. It was simply the ability to listen to one another, to be present, to twist a moment into a stupid joke, an amusement exactly shared between them.

She'd found it, the skill of sharing time, with Sunil. The line she'd used on Chase was one that Sunil had used on her, freshman year, when he'd heard her crying, and come into the restroom to comfort her.

"I feel like I can tell you anything," Sunitha had said, a week later, in a new ecstasy of friendship.

"Of course," he had said. "Why couldn't you?"

Everything else, musically and academically, followed. It was a kind of magic to people, listening to them, like they could read each other's minds. Really, it was just living, moment to moment, with the visceral acknowledgment that another person was like you. The world was shared with them.

"Exactly half," Sunil had said, when she asked him how much of the song writing credits would be hers. It was his answer, too, to royalty checks and bills for meals they ate together, regardless of who had ordered what. Nico, too, had made that a condition of his funding: half for you, half to anyone you chose to hire and pay for something they can do. She'd given a fourth to the Luthier, and a fourth to Sunil.

Sunil had given half to her, and half to Babacar. Gaming the system, as usual.

It was a weird variation on the prisoner's dilemma. The responsibility of one who was free. She had been reading the room, before the explosion, the same way that she was reading Sunil, his tells and tips. Everybody knew about the trucks, and was getting nervous.

Their half-set had turned into a full set, and news spread about the surf-rock band deciding to just set up a stage on the road, in defiance of the blockade. The Glider Guns decided to support them, and when they started their sound check, had also run the sound board through the Snow-foot's speakers, tuning her mellow acoustic instruments to the shrill electric guitars.

"Crypto, in itself, is worthless. Human life, on its own, is also worthless." Sunil was playing bits of audio from presentations and videos from the conference, with some off-the cuff samples she thought might have been surreptitiously recorded conversations. "The only value anything in your portfolio has, is its ability to affect the world. Tangible, lived experience. The quality of the air you breathe, or food you eat, or water you drink. Don't be afraid to fold abstracted value back into living tissues."

Sunitha took what Sunil was throwing at her, from the streams of the other concert, which he strobed at varying levels of volume and distortion, to the quotes, and danced around the weight of those slow sources of sound with her own whip-fast tangles of notes. Her mind processed possibilities of music with the same unconscious, preternatural accuracy of a prehistoric human casting a spear at a distant elk. "Even NFTS are worthless, as music or art," the voice went on, someone Sunitha had never heard before. "Their value likes only, exclusively, in their ability to generate more music or art."

This was, again, before the explosions.

I'm dwelling on it because its the last chance any of the characters will have to indulge in speculative thinking about music, or crypto, before the animal hind-brain kicks in once their survival is threatened, when they have to take flight or fight.

You, dear reader, also deserve some music without moralism, an interlude before the inescapable falling action.

"DAOS, cryptos, don't represent anything original, let alone revolutionary, in terms of organizing. It's just the same battlefield drifted into new terms, relief soldiers of generations undestroyed. The only thing web3 changes is the new location of the essential tools, a switch-up in the scramble to see who will get to understand and use them. Decision making, relationships between nodes in the super-organic god-heads, are becoming decentralized, which will upset existing structures of persuasive power."
