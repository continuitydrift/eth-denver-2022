# 16: Mash-ups

Sunitha remembered obsessing over older girls, the way they talked. Later, it would be professors, or tech millionaires. The thing, she realized, that had given her an almost sacred fire of jealously, of wanting to be in that inner circle, the formula she had never been able to understand, was the opposite of a formula. There was no algorithm or structure that could be followed or reproduced. It was simply the ability to listen to one another, to be present, to twist a moment into a stupid joke, an amusement exactly shared between them.

She'd found it, the skill of sharing time, with Sunil. The line she'd used on Chase was one that Sunil had used on her, freshman year, when he'd heard her crying, and come into the restroom to comfort her.

"I feel like I can tell you anything," Sunitha had said, a week later, in a new ecstasy of friendship.

"Of course," he had said. "Why couldn't you?"

Everything else, musically and academically, followed. It was a kind of magic to people, listening to them, like they could read each other's minds. Really, it was just living, moment to moment, with the visceral acknowledgment that another person was like you. The world was shared with them.

"Exactly half," Sunil had said, when she asked him how much of the song writing credits would be hers. It was his answer, too, to royalty checks and bills for meals they ate together, regardless of who had ordered what. Nico had made that a condition of his funding: half for you, half to anyone you chose to hire and pay for something they can do.

Sunil had given the other half of his payment to her. Gaming the system, as usual.

She had been reading the room, before the explosion, the same way that she was reading Sunil, his tells and tips. Everybody knew about the trucks, and was getting nervous.

Their half-set had turned into a full set, and news spread about the surf-rock band deciding to just set up a stage on the road, in defiance of the blockade. When they had started their sound check, the Glider Guns had also run the sound board through the Snow-foot's speakers, tuning her mellow acoustic instruments to the shrill electric guitars.

"Crypto, in itself, is worthless. Human life, on its own, is also worthless." Sunil was playing bits of audio from presentations and videos from the conference, with some off-the-cuff samples she thought might have been surreptitiously recorded conversations. "The only value anything in your portfolio has, is its ability to affect the world. Tangible, lived experience. The quality of the air you breathe, or food you eat, or water you drink. Don't be afraid to fold abstracted value back into living tissues."

Sunitha took what Sunil was throwing at her, from the streams of the other concert, which he strobed at varying levels of volume and distortion, to the quotes, and danced around the weight of those sources of sound with her own whip-fast tangles of notes. Her mind processed possibilities of music with the same unconscious accuracy with which a prehistoric human must cast a spear at a distant elk. "Even NFTS are worthless, as music or art," the voice went on, someone Sunitha had never heard before. "Their value lies only, exclusively, in their ability to generate more music or art."

This was, again, before the explosions.

I'm dwelling on it because its the last chance any of the characters will have to indulge in speculative thinking about music, or crypto, before the animal hind-brain kicks in once their survival is threatened, when they have to take flight or fight.

"DAOS, cryptos, don't represent anything original, let alone revolutionary, in terms of organizing. It's just the same battlefield drifted into new terms, relief soldiers of generations undestroyed. The only thing web3 changes is the new location of the essential tools, a switch-up in the scramble to see who will get to understand and use them. Decision making, relationships between nodes in the super-organic god-heads, are becoming decentralized, which will upset existing structures of persuasive power."

The internet came back, or appeared to. A lot of people in the room were checking their phones, nervously.

"Do you want to play the market?" Sunil asked her.

It was a gimmick they'd considered, and rejected, one of the folders of forgotten code that had been rejected because the programs had failed to produce anything musical. Noise without signal.

Explanations about what happened would differ. It is possible that hackers took control over all of the devices at the Snow-foot. Fed them false data, spoofed all of the sources of information that were confirming the localized, subjective timeline of events. How, though, did the hackers so accurately predict what the rest of the world would agree happened *after* the trucks turned into fireballs? How could they have given the hundreds of people staying at the lodge accurate stock and crypto market data, from all of the major exchanges, apparently from the future?

Sell or buy orders were found not to have gone through, or to have time stamps that conflicted with those of the live stream, when Sunil and Sunitha were on stage, playing a song improvised based on real-time prices of Truthereum and Goalrand.

The program Sunil had written took the price of a digital asset, like Truthereum, Goalrand, or Bytecoin, and transposed the line, plotted over an axis of real time, into musical notes. The oscillations were rendered into salient steps in a common key, time intervals normalized into punctuated beats that approximated rhythm.

There was no multi-media screen behind them, like there had been at the temple, but Sunil was broadcasting the live-stream that Babacar was supposed to be managing.

Both Truthereum and Goalrand were plummeting. Sunitha and Sunil had bots running that would be responding to conditions as best they could, balancing their portfolios, trying to mitigate impermanent loss with the arbitrage opportunities bubbling up from the froth and carnage.

Part of Sunitha wanted to stop the concert, to give everyone there investment advice. She could feel it, hear it in the music. This was more than a usual correction. This was price discovery on a cosmic scale, some essential line of support or resistance getting erased, forever. If only she knew which.

Both Truthereum and Goalrand were plummeting. Sunitha could almost hear the bots trying to catch the falling knives, cutting the wires of their unfeeling fingers. The numbers fell past the expected range, the program rendering them as sub-audible, and then started again at the top, recalibrating, tumbling down through rapidly depreciating arpeggios.

Sunil and Sunitha had been playing a dirge in honor of all that wiped out wealth, that flash crash of consequent, compounding liquidations. This was how she had been so sure, when questioned in the police station, about the timing of events. First the crash, Goalrand leading the charge, playing a frantic bass line, with Truthereum teetering and sliding next, and Bytecoin falling last and hardest. Then the explosion.

Sunil, before she had met him, had been heavily into the mash-up scene, a more edgy niche of remix culture, more focused on poking holes in claims of copyright. He would take a measure or less of an immediately recognizable popular hit, and warp it, changng the tempo or pitch or tone, and then blend it with something else. The trick, the thing mash-up artists prized in themselves and others, was the ability to combine unlikely, incongruous elements. Music that shouldn't fit together, but did. Simpering boy-bands ruthlessly shoved under grunge metal or trap beats, dusty soul albums chopped up and layered over drum and bass. Good mash-ups revealed the underlying similarity, the common chord changes, once the songs were stripped down for parts.

When she'd asked Sunil about it, if he minded that it was derivative, if he wasn't putting himself at the level of fawning fan-boy of mass-produced pop culture, he had told her no, he intentionally chose songs he hated, that had gotten stuck in his head, and wouldn't let him hear anything else. He was just using the ear-worms to catch larger fish. "We have all this terrible, catchy music forced constantly into our ears, through commercials, movies, parties. Rusty hooks trawling through the sound-waves. They get stuck, like plastic in our gut, making us feel full but with no nutrition. Ear worms are like tape worms. Parasites, using us to find other hosts. Mash-ups are the only way we have to fight back, to begin to break them down. Copyright infringement is the only way to protect ourselves from being dumbed down, musically, by a commercialized society."

Sunitha thought of that conversation now, with the insistent brain-dead progressions of surfer rock coming from the screens and windows. Sunil was breaking it down, warping it, running it through filters. Digesting. Turning it from a mental inevitability, an immutable and indestructible loop, back into the shit it really was, so that it could be eliminated.

Everyone who had tried to encourage them with music wanted them to turn their energies to the production of singular, salable objects. Commodities. One definitive recording, one album or set of NFTs that could persist forever in a perfect state. A record, of something that had already happened, and couldn't be revised, remixed, or played differently. For the Glider Guns, (the vocalist and bassist excluded, which is why they were probably going to leave the band), the only kind of music worth making was the kind that could change and drift, that came from listening and response. Not knowing what came next, until it did. They only released LPs and EPs to fund live shows, hopefully a tour, although most venues would want to know what to expect up front, what well-defined niche of consumer they could market them to, *sans* surprises.

That night, with Sunil transposing market ticks into beats, and candles into changes between notes, her wrapping cello strings around that dropping knife of chaos and the frat-boy power chords from the stage down the road, was the best they had ever played.

Then, the explosion happened on their screens after they heard it, sound traveling faster than wi-fi that had to bounce off satellites even to travel a kilometer away. For a few bars, the bleeps and ambient synths continued, and she finished the verse, unwilling, even in the face of catastrophe, to leave the phrase unfinished.

Then she thought about Matty, and her family.
