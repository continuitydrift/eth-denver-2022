# 18: Sympathy

"You can stay as long as you want," Marcus had said to Chase, when Babacar was there. "You too, dude," he said to Babacar, recovering. Babacar looked away, smiling, knowing that he made too much eye-contact, that it was some kind of a cultural difference.

Everyone seemed to be quitting their jobs or getting fired, dropping out of school, casting new ships out to sea, but we was going back to his job in Portland as a parking-lot attendant, to his room in the house that was too small to legally list on Earth bnb, legally, so they rented it to him by month, at a rate he could afford, putting up with the constant churn of strange new visitors, and laundry.

"I can work on the game while at work," he said. "They literally just pay me for sitting there." The truth was, he had never been without a normal job, and the idea of casting his lot with a vaguely-defined internet start-up poked at some ill-defined work ethic ingrained from childhood. Without a pay-check, however small, he felt fraudulent and insecure.

He'd been unemployed, once, for over a year. Falling for various multi-level pyramid schemes and hustle-hungry internet scams. He'd gone to food pantries, to mosques, and pretended to be more faithful than he was.

Babacar did feel like some train was leaving the station, that he was being left behind. As much as the rest of the team promised to keep in touch remotely, he know that there was a *je nes sais quoi* to being in the same place, breathing the same air. He´d talked to Sunitha about sex, about being attracted to her. It came down, she said, to a phobia about bacteria, about microbes, or microbiomes.

What was a symbol, a representation, for what? Was her being aromantic, averse to physical intimacy, an expression of germaphobia, or the reverse? Ultimately, it didn't matter, the result was the same: she didn't want to sleep with him. The choice was either to respect the boundaries she had set, or to interrogate them, challenge them according to some prerogative that confused the rational with the sexual.

*Love is what doesn't ask why*, his ex had told him, and it went both ways. The absence of reciprocation must necessarily be inexplicable. It was the hardest, and the oldest, of the challenges one must face.

He didn't feel like he would fit in with Chase and Marcus, or with Denver, where everything was expensive and few people had tattoos. He'd never been without a normal job, and some in-grained work ethic meant that without a paycheck however small, he felt fraudulent and insecure. Nico had shelled out another generous round of funding, with the usual condition that half had to be paid out to others, but there was no guarantee, despite now being a fully-fledged member of the guild, that the income would be sustainable. The Daemon treasury, also, would now be taking their 10%, and the payout was in DAEMON coin. While he could theoretically convert all his earnings into fiat, DAO members were encouraged to put their gains back into the liquidity pool on Giant, the biggest decentralized exchange for Goalrand.

It was three weeks after the Breckenridge retreat, and less than a week before the end of the virtual hackathon. They were sitting in Marcus's backyard, with honeysuckle and Magnolia not yet budding, garden beds planted with carrots and noodle beans, trellises waiting to be climbed. Matty had left, a week after her family almost got blown up, frustrated with a lack of closure. The explosion had been pinned on a radical cell of animal-rights activists, who had been sold the explosives by federal agents in what their lawyers were calling entrapment. The detonators the spies had given them were supposed to be faulty, but through either ingenuity on the part of the activists or incompetence on the part of the agents, they hadn't been. Nothing had come out about an online cult wearing animal masks.

Babacar had expected, he had to admit, some kind of official take on things. Reports made to police, some final and unequivocal conclusion, but the lack of any epistemological clarity fit with his experience of crypto as a whole: the age of meta-narratives was over. Knowledge itself had become horizontal, crowd-sourced, balkanized. Everything, now, was an interminable play of suspect surfaces, waves of self-replicating memes, weaponized to grow beyond the cognizance of any creator or interpreter.

Russia had invaded Ukraine, the United States supporting the resistance with supplies and sanctions, stopping short of declaring a no-fly zone. Both nuclear super-powers were accusing the others of brainwashing, propaganda, and war crimes.

Sunitha and Sunil showed up, bringing tofu tacos they'd picked up from food carts, using the last of the air-dropped credits from the conference. "What's it going for now?" Sunitha asked Marcus, talking about the NFT that Chase had helped him mint from the infamous few seconds of video on his phone. It was chilly on the back porch, but there were no insects.

"A lot," Chase answered for him. Apparently, both Chase and Marcus were doing well. Not only had Chase's lost crypto reappeared, but he'd been sent dozens of low-resolution NFTs of anthropomorphic cartoon animals. He'd ignored them for several days, until curiosity prompted him to check the floor price of pieces from the same collection. If PirateSea was to believed, they were worth several hundred thousand dollars in Truthereum.

Sunil and Sunitha were headed back to Boston, deciding not to drop out of their master's program just yet, despite the success of the Glider Guns project and their new membership in the Daemon DAO. Marcus had been the only one the Daemon DAO hadn't offered membership to, but Misses Penguins, the board-rock band, had offered him a job making making BlueTube videos of their tour. He was leaving in the morning, around the same time as Babacar.

Chase, it seemed, also not having a job to go back to, was going to dog-sit Pierrot, Chase's American Bulldog that was currently torn between gnawing a tennis ball to death and watching squirrels.

"Let's not stream the game tonight," Babacar said, in a pause in the conversation.

"Are you sure?" Marcus asked him. "You got a lot of new subscriptions last time. Sunitha's channel, too, was racking up a lot of tips."

"Yeah," Babacar said, enjoying the sound of traffic, the forbidden smell of barbeque up the street. "It's our last night together, for a while. Let's still play, and have music, and we can conference Nico in, but I don't feel like doing a stream."

Sunitha was looking at him, using his own trick of unbreaking eye contact that Chase had said was terrifying. "I'm not afraid of the trolls."

"That's not it. I just want to be here, with you all, not with the internet."

The moon came up, full or nearly so, and Sunitha played her grandfather's sitar, stirring in each of them hidden, sympathetic strings.
