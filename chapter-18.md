"You can stay as long as you want," Marcus had said to Chase, when Babacar was there. "You too, dude," he said to Babacar, recovering. Babacar looked away, smiling, knowing that he made too much eye-contact, that it was some kind of a cultural difference.

Everyone seemed to be quitting their jobs or getting fired, dropping out of school, casting new ships out to sea, but we was going back to his job in Portland as a parking-lot attendant, to his room in the house that was too small to legally list on Earth bnb, legally, so they rented it to him by month, at a rate he could afford, putting up with the constant churn of strange new visitors, and laundry.

"I can work on the game while at work," he said. "They literally just pay me for sitting there." The truth was, he had never been without a normal job, and the idea of casting his lot with a vaguely-defined internet start-up poked at some ill-defined work ethic ingrained from childhood. Without a pay-check, however small, he felt fraudulent and insecure.

He'd been unemployed, once, for over a year. Falling for various multi-level pyramid schemes and hustle-hungry internet scams. He'd gone to food pantries, to mosques, and pretended to be more faithful than he was.

Babacar did feel like some train was leaving the station, that he was being left behind. As much as the rest of the team promised to keep in touch remotely, he know that there was a je nes sais quoi to being in the same place, breathing the same air. HeÂ´d talked to Sunitha about sex, about being attracted to her. It came down, she said, to a phobia about bacteria, about microbes, or microbiomes.

What was a symbol, a representation, for what? Was her being aromantic, averse to physical intimacy, an expression of germaphobia, or the reverse? Ultimately, it didn't matter, the result was the same: she didn't want to sleep with him. The choice was either to respect the boundaries she had set, or to interrogate them, challenge them according to some prerogative that confused the rational with the sexual.

*Love is what doesn't ask why*, his ex had told him, and it went both ways. The absence of reciprocation must necessarily be inexplicable. It was the hardest, and the oldest, of the challenges one must face.
