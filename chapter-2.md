# Chapter 2

Matty woke up when some kinds came back to the hotel drunk, around two or three in the morning. For a second, she thought they were her own children, her fears realized: they had grown up, and irresponsible, overnight. The jokes she had made with the over the Boom call before they went to bed, warning her 13 year old not to go to any parties without her, transmuted by dream logic into reality. The book she'd been reading them "The Tree that Set Appropriate Boundaries", was in the sheets next to her, where Brian should have been. The room smelled wrong and unfamiliar.

She got up and went to pee, listening to the group of young people laughing through the thin walls. The smell of weed came through the vents. She looked into the mirror, trying to mentally erase the sags and wrinkles, imagining herself at their age. It didn't work. It had been a different country, literally and metaphorically. A different world. Instead, she saw Jenny, a few years older than she was now, the blunt but striking beauty that had been foreshadowed by her experiments with make-up. Matty had cried when she'd seen her, not understanding why.

Matty didn't miss being young, the heady mix of egoism and insecurity, polar fluctuations between things being *the best* and *the worst*, *hot* and *gross*, the heavens and hells of hormones. She didn't envy the kids next door when they would have to get up in the morning. Well, maybe a little.

She straightened the covers, rubbing warmth back into her feet under the warmth of the bed, putting some music on that helped her sleep when tinnitus kept ringing her back awake. She ignored the waiting messages, the **feed**. *Your desires are not my own*, she thought tot he phone, the mantra she had taught herself. *You want me to scroll. I want to sleep.* She did open the message from Brian, sent an hour or so after the video call. *We love you*.

"I love you too," she said out loud. The phone probably thought she was talking to it.

The next morning she went to a yoga session hosted by FemDAO, a women-centric and women-led organization she'd been happy to see included in the schedule. It was a short walk, the air surprisingly warm, to the large, pastel-covered studio with mandalas and cut-out copper vines spinning sillhouettes out onto the walls.
